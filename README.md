# Real-world Enhancements
- Add Polly for retry, circuit breaker.
- Use Swagger with API Gateway using tools like SwaggerForOcelot.
- Integrate logging/tracing (e.g., Serilog + OpenTelemetry).
- Add Docker/Kubernetes deployment.

# Project Structure
# Example structure:

/ApiGateway           ‚Üí Ocelot API Gateway
/CustomerService      ‚Üí Microservice 1
/OrderService         ‚Üí Microservice 2
/ProductService       ‚Üí Microservice 3
Each service runs independently, communicates via REST (or gRPC/event-based in advanced cases).
